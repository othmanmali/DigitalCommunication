# DigitalCommunication
Generate a random stream of bits of 20 bits.
Modulate this data using QPSK with frequency of 1 Hz.
Plot the input stream of bits and the modulated Signal using QPSK.
Upload your work in pdf format with both the code and output graphs.
Note: please don't use the communication toolbox for QPSK modulation.
